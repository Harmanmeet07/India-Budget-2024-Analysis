The budget allocation data presents a significant spread and a few key observations can be made from the given statistics:

High Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is ₹264,082.30 crores, which is much larger than the mean of ₹86,649.17 crores. This indicates a high variability in budget allocations, suggesting that some allocations are extremely high compared to others.

Extremely Wide Range: The range, calculated as the difference between the maximum (₹1,850,229.87 crores) and minimum (₹192.55 crores) budget allocations, is ₹1,850,037.32 crores. This wide range further supports the presence of significant disparities among budget allocations.

Mean vs. Median: The mean budget allocation is ₹86,649.17 crores, while the median is much lower at ₹10,404.63 crores. This substantial difference indicates a right-skewed distribution, where a few very large allocations are inflating the mean.

Outliers: Given the high maximum value compared to the mean and median, it is likely that there are outliers (very high budget allocations) that are influencing the average. These outliers could be specific sectors or projects that receive significantly more funding than others.

Skewness: The data is likely skewed to the right (positively skewed), meaning that most of the budget allocations are concentrated at the lower end, with a few very high values pulling the mean to the right.

This focus aims to enhance connectivity, facilitate economic activities, and support overall infrastructure development.
